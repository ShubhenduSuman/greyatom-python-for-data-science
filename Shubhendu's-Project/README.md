 The project was challenging as I am learning. Thank You.


### Learnings from the project

 I did learn handling the program flow with python. I learned how to use conditional statements, handling file operations, etc.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Basically I took the note of concept that I thought of difficult, and that helped me a lot with the projects.


### Challenges faced

 It was a challenge for me to handle how to put conditional statements Message Substitutionsection. But I tried again & again with so many different approach and finally my codes got executed.
Overall the project was actually a good one that covered the whole concept.
